# Emotions-Predictions
Emotions prediction using RNN with LSTM  cells and Attention Mechanisms
This repository contains 4 models mixing between the LSTM cells and the Attention mechanism.
We consider shallow (1 hidden layer) and deep (3 hidden layers) architectures.
Finally the optimizers used are : SGD and Adam. Thus, we have 16 models in total
